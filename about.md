## How this site started out
Well, everyone had a blog site, so I started one too. I decided not to use
services such as [Medium](https://medium.com) or [Wordpress](https://wordpress.c
om). Then, I created my own Jekyll theme and hosted my website on github. Easy
as that.

## Is the site monetized?
Not really. I orginally wanted to add in Google Adsense but decided against it.
So, you'll never see any Ads or sponsors on my site.

## Data Collection (Non-Existent)
I aim to collect the least amount of data from anyone who views my site.
However, some of your data might be collected by services like [Formspree](https
://formspree.io/). I try to reduce my reliance on these services but they are
needed for added functionality on my site.

## AI(LLM) Usage
Well... stuff get a bit more complicated here. Sometimes, my writing style might
seem like LLM-generated text. But none of the text written on the site is
directly LLM generated. However, I do use AI search and research tools to find
information that can be useful for my writing. I am trying to actively reduce
it.
